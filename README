COMPILING

To create your own version you'll need xCode preferably. However, as this is OpenFrameworks
thereis a good chance that this will compile for Windows though probably without the video
recording bit. You'll also need to create your own Code::Blocks project.

There are several add-ons you'll need; all are available from the Openframeworks Contributed
Add-Ons page. MSAInteractiveObject, XMLSettings, OpenCV and GuiTool are the ones you'll need.
Although I have included them using my paths you'll need to make sure they exist.

You should place all this inside a directory called 
'ScreenSpaceAmbientOcclusion' within your:

Openframeworks Dir / Apps / examples

That way, things should work quite easily.
